Too many Azure Tenants under Switch Directory in Azure Portal?

Microsoft explained this in detail in the docs:
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/leave-the-organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/b2b/leave-the-organization)

### Leave an organization

Here's a brief instruction copied from the docs.

1. Go to your Access Panel Profile page by doing one of the following steps: 
    - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click your name in the upper right and select **View account**.
    - Open your [Access Panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com/), click your name in the upper right, and next to **Organizations**, select the settings icon (gear).
